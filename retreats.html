	<h3>Our Philosophy</h3>

	<p>We don’t as much believe in absolute pose alignment as we believe in individual body alignment, but our mentality is: postural alignment is crucial, a lot of issues originate in it, so a lot of focus will be placed on it during our classes.</p>

	<img class="m-doubleExposure" src="/assets/images/retreat/double-exposure.jpg">

	<h3 class="u-text-right">Why would you pick this course over others?</h3>

	<ul class="u-pull-right list-bullets">
		<li>You’ll get to dip a toe or two into Hatha, Vinyasa, Yin and Iyengar yoga, as well as Pranayama and Meditation.</li>
		<li>3 vegetarian meals/day, made from local Mediterranean ingredients, are always a win.</li>
		<li>You can hike in the mountains, swim in the pool, ride on horseback. We do sound awesome, but you don’t want to hang out with us 24/7, do you?</li>
		<li>You’ll get a chance to broaden your mind as well as deepen your poses.</li>

				<h3 class="m-accordion-contentTitle">Setting</h3>

				<p>Our retreat will be located at the beautiful Grazalema house which is tucked in the middle of a Nature Reserve just outside the city of Ronda, in Andalucia.</p>

				<figure class="m-accordion-image">
					<img src="/assets/images/retreat/setting.jpg">
				</figure>

				<p>There is a big house and 6 apartments which all have access to the 5 swimming pools and the 25,000sq-meter garden around the premises. There is a lovely porch and terrace at all the houses where you can enjoy the view over the beautiful Andalucian hills.</p>

				<p>We have a separate yoga shala as well, equipped with mats and props for all our yoga-needs and our meals will be served in the big house. There is also a tennis field and several hiking trails for you to enjoy during our retreat.</p>
			</li>
			<li id="accordion-location">
				<h3 class="m-accordion-contentTitle">Location</h3>

				<p>The retreat is located at <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Calle+Parche,+26,+11687+El+Gastor,+C%C3%A1diz,+Spain/@36.85413,-5.3260487,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0xd0d40b8fd1d6355:0xc16d88da254d5521">Calle Parche, 26, 11687 El Gastor, Cádiz, Spain</a>. This is 1h 20 mins from Jerez airport, 1h 30 mins from Sevilla airport, or 1h 30 mins from Malaga airport.</p>

				<figure class="m-accordion-image">
					<img src="/assets/images/retreat/location.jpg">
				</figure>

				<p>Malaga airport is the closest to Grazalema house. If you wish to have an airport-transfer we are very happy to both pick you up and drop you off in time for your flight after the retreat. A transfer there and back will cost an additional €59.</p>

				<p>You can also get there via train or bus to Ronda. Both buses and trains leave Malaga city regularly throughout the day and we will pick you up from the bus/train station in Ronda for the 10 minute drive to Grazalema house.</p>
			</li>
			<li id="accordion-bedroom">
				<h3 class="m-accordion-contentTitle">Rooms</h3>

				<p class="margin-top-0">In Grazalema house there are either single or double occupancy rooms offered. All houses are beautifully decorated and all have private bathrooms attached and there is WiFi, LED TV, air-conditioner and heaters in each room.</p>

				<figure class="m-accordion-image margin-left-0">
					<img src="/assets/images/retreat/rooms.jpg">
				</figure>
			</li>
			<li id="accordion-meals">
				<h3 class="m-accordion-contentTitle">Meals</h3>

				<p>All of your meals are included in the retreat and we will serve you a lovely prepared buffet-style breakfast, lunch and dinner every day. On the arrival day, dinner is included and departure day we will serve you breakfast.</p>

				<figure class="m-accordion-image">
					<img src="/assets/images/retreat/meals.jpg">
				</figure>

				<p>All the food served will be well balanced, gluten-free and vegan and planned by our food-expert Emma to make sure that you are well taken care of during the retreat.</p>

				<p>If you have any food-allergies or special requests, please do not hesitate to tell us so that we can prepare the best alternative for your needs.</p>
			</li>
			<li id="accordion-course">
				<h3 class="m-accordion-contentTitle">Course</h3>

				<p>The retreat will begin with a full anatomical assessment, so as to tailor the sequences to target individual body quirks such as spine and postural issues (spondylitis, scoliosis, hyper-lordosis, etc), joint issues (arthritis, chronic knee pain), and provide solutions around your lifestyle (eg. how to keep a healthy posture if you sit in an office chair 8h+ a day).</p>

				<figure class="m-accordion-image">
					<img src="/assets/images/retreat/course.jpg">
				</figure>

				<p>It will provide also an introduction to breathing techniques (pranayama), relaxation techniques, and meditation. It will give you the experience and knowledge to personalise your own yoga practice for years to come. And it will also give you a chance to explore the unique nature around the place, through bushwalks, canoeing, kayaking and more.</p>
			</li>
			<li id="accordion-schedule">
				<h3 class="m-accordion-contentTitle">Schedule</h3>

				<p>Beginners will be offered a wonderful (re)introduction to the practice of yoga and the more advanced will have a chance to revisit and enrich their practice with perhaps a(n) new/alternate vision. Individual attention and options customised in the classroom environment will ensure you enjoy a safe but challenging experience.</p>

					<li class="m-faqs-question">Are activities included in the yoga retreat?</li>

					<li class="m-faqs-question">How can I get to the yoga retreat?</li>
					<li class="m-faqs-answer">The best option is to rent a car from the airport for your entire stay. It´s cheaper than a taxi and that way you can enjoy the freedom of transportation every day on the retreat.</li>

					<li class="m-faqs-question">I need a special diet, can you provide it?</li>
					<li class="m-faqs-answer">Of course! As long as you let us know before your arrival, we can prepare the diet you need. For example, if you are gluten intolerant, vegan, or have any other special diet needs.</li>

					<li class="m-faqs-question">Are cancellations allowed?</li>
					<li class="m-faqs-answer">You can cancel your reservation up to 60 days before the retreat. If you cancel after the allotted time period you'll lose the deposit or you can transfer it to another guest.</li>

					<li class="m-faqs-question">What should I bring?</li>
					<li class="m-faqs-answer">Bring comfortable clothing for practicing yoga, a swimsuit, beach towel, sunscreen, and your yoga mat (although we'll provide one if you don't have).</li>

	<h2>Karen Pasquel</h2>

	<p>This retreat will be run by myself and <a href="http://kpyogainspiration.com">Karen Pasquel</a>.</p>

	<figure class="u-pull-right image-small">
		<img src="/assets/images/retreat/karen.jpg">
	</figure>

	<p>Karen loves a challenge and, since she’d always excelled at all sports she’d tried, soccer included, yoga came as a natural progression. However surprisingly, or perhaps not so surprisingly, she discovered herself initially to be unprepared for yoga. She wasn’t as bendy as she’d thought, in body or mind.</p>

	<p>Gradually though, yoga brought her in touch with her own body in a way unlike anything she’d experienced before, made her more mindful, more aware of her thoughts, actions and emotions, and less competitive. Yoga has taught her to not compare herself with others, but rather to celebrate everyone’s differences.</p>

	<p>Today her biggest passion is to share the gift of yoga, linking Breath and Movement with Intention. She sees yoga as a way of life — something to practice both on and off the mat. She also loves to share her delicious smoothie and raw vegan cake recipes to infuse more energy and fun into the after practice.</p>
