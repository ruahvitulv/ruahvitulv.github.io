				<h1>About Rua</h1>
				<p>The sheer truth is that Rua was a terribly inconstant yoga practitioner. And student.</p>
				<p>She didn’t go do yoga because she had back aches. Her back was just fine.</p>
				<p>She didn’t go do yoga for the spiritual side of it because she thought that that was ludicrous.</p>
				<p>She didn’t go do yoga to be surrounded by hipsters, because she can’t stand them. Even though she is one.</p>
				<p>She stumbled upon yoga thanks to this dude she was frantically dating and because she discovered she couldn’t cross her legs.</p>
				<p>Seriously. She really couldn’t.</p>
				<p>She had tried getting properly into yoga time and time again over the past decade or so but it wouldn’t stick. She had a bit of a problem with hearing about crystals and full moons, she’s rather skeptical. Side effect of studying too much maths for her own good.</p>
				<p>She’ll never be the one to do 10 hours a day although she’s met a few. And she’ll always combine within her approach a sound scientific approach. She just can’t be convinced otherwise, and it’s the kind of convection she needs to refresh regularly.</p>
				<p>She has though been doing it more or less regularly through the past 2 years, and has in the meantime garnered a series of certifications to trick people into giving her some money for not too much work.</p>
				<p>While in India, although she still sucked at crossing her legs many people seemed to really love her classes, including her outstanding gurus, the pranayama and the asana teacher.</p>
				<p>This site is an attempt for her to finally commit and get better as a teacher. She’ll be trying really hard. She promises.</p>
