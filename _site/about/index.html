<p>I have always been scientifically inclined and skeptical to a fault. Thus it came as a big surprise for those who knew me to hear I had gone to India to become a yoga teacher. Abandoning a very promising - and miserable - career in IT in Australia.</p>

<p>There’s a quote from Richard Bach’s “Illusions” that comes to mind whenever I think of myself as a teacher of yoga: <em>“You teach best what you most need to learn.”</em></p>

<p>Having experienced yoga for years without finding my way, I am today in the position of saying that it might just be okay to not find your way as long as you keep on actively looking, and working towards it.</p>

<p>I believe in sharing yoga as the integrative phenomenon that it is, not as a sport - that’s asana, which is only one of its 8 limbs - at the same time taking the effort to understand and filter through the mirages and explore what works for the individual.</p>

<p>Yoga asana is exercise with the potential to be infinitely more, but that doesn’t mean it needs to be religion. It’s discipline within yourself.</p>

<p>What I am striving for is teach it the way I would have always wanted to be taught. My long-term goal is to gather around me a new generation of yoga practitioners who think of yoga critically, not superstitiously, who want to learn to work healthily and integrate balance and sustainability in their lives; to offer a resource for those who want to approach it but also for those who simply want to understand yoga without practicing it; to offer a space for those who have tried and failed to get into it many times before, to try once more.</p>

<p>One size fits all won’t do for me. <em>“Adapting yoga to suit the needs of every unique individual is where the true greatness of yoga lies”</em> as TKV Desikachar once put it, and it’s how my classes inevitably develop.</p>

<p>In my private space I turn to yoga again and again because it reminds me that I am not perfect and, especially, that that’s ok.</p>
