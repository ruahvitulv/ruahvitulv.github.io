I have always been scientifically inclined and skeptical to a fault. Thus it came as a big surprise for those who knew me to hear I had gone to India to become a yoga teacher. Abandoning a very promising - and joyless - career in corporate IT, in Australia.

There’s a quote from Richard Bach’s “Illusions” that comes to mind whenever I think of myself as a teacher of yoga: *“You teach best what you most need to learn.”*

Having experienced yoga for years without finding my way, I am today in the position of saying that it might just be okay to not find your way as long as you keep on actively looking, and working towards it.

I believe in sharing yoga as the integrative phenomenon that it is, not as a sport - that’s asana, which is only one of its 8 limbs - at the same time taking the effort to understand and filter through the mirages and explore what works for the individual.

Yoga asana is exercise with the potential to be infinitely more, but that doesn’t mean it needs to be religion. It’s discipline within yourself.

What I am striving for is teach it the way I would have always wanted to be taught. My long-term goal is to gather around me a new generation of yoga practitioners who think of yoga critically, not superstitiously, who want to learn to work healthily and integrate balance and sustainability in their lives; to offer a resource for those who want to approach it but also for those who simply want to understand yoga without practicing it; to offer a space for those who have tried and failed to get into it many times before, to try once more.

One size fits all won’t do for me. *“Adapting yoga to suit the needs of every unique individual is where the true greatness of yoga lies”* as TKV Desikachar once put it, and it’s how my classes inevitably develop.

Today I teach yoga while travelling the world, in group retreats and one-to-one classes, work on independent graphic and photography projects, do journalistic collaborations. In my private space I turn to yoga again and again because it reminds me that I am not perfect and, especially, that that’s ok.
