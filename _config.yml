description: "Aimed towards a new generation of yoga practitioners who think of yoga critically, not superstitiously, who want to learn to work healthily and integrate balance and sustainability in their lives. A resource for those who want to approach it but also for those who simply want to understand yoga without practicing it. A space for those who have tried and failed to get into it many times before - to try once more."
